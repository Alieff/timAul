This repository is a project that is used to develop **Inspire Crawler** for our scrum project. It will be available in another repository as This repository won't be used to develop the crawler. The new repository will be focused for crawler only and this repository will be focused on API and website. 

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository's usage is:
* To show progress about our software (Inspire Crawler, Website)

### How do I get set up? ###
We use maven dependencies, so to run it you need to set the classpath.

These are the library that we used for this project:
* crawler4j (has many dependecies)
* stanford-core-nlp 

to run our crawler, set it up by yourself or wait for us to release the jar files.
